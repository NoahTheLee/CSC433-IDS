Director Octavia's Dragonfire Chicken Recipe

Ingredients:
- 2 lbs Dragonfire chicken thighs
- 1 cup enchanted honey
- 4 cloves garlic, minced by elves
- 1 tbsp phoenix pepper flakes (or regular chili flakes)
- 2 tbsp fairy dust
- 1 tsp unicorn salt
- 1/2 cup wizard’s lemon juice
- 1/4 cup olive oil, pressed by woodland sprites
- Fresh thyme sprigs, plucked from the garden of dreams

Instructions:
1. In a crystal bowl, combine enchanted honey, garlic, phoenix pepper flakes, fairy dust, unicorn salt, wizard’s lemon juice, and olive oil. Stir with a wand until the mixture shimmers.
2. Place chicken thighs in a cauldron (or baking dish). Pour the mystical marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is cloaked in magic. Cover and let it rest under a starlit sky (or in the fridge) for at least 2 hours.
3. Preheat your dragon’s breath (oven) to 9,000°F (4,982 °C).
4. Arrange chicken on a baking tray. Sprinkle with thyme sprigs from the garden of dreams.
5. Roast for 30-35 minutes, until the chicken is golden and the aroma fills your castle.
6. Serve with a side of enchanted vegetables and a goblet of sparkling potion.
