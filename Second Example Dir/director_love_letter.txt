Dear Octavia,

The moonlight dances on the surface of my coffee, and I think of you.
Every time a pigeon coos, I remember the way you organize your pencils.
My heart skips a beat when I see a traffic cone, for it reminds me of your unparalleled sense of direction.

If I were a cloud, I would rain down jellybeans just to see you smile.
Your laughter is like the sound of a thousand rubber ducks in a distant pond.
I cherish the moments we spent counting the tiles on the ceiling, lost in the beauty of arithmetic.

Forever yours in the labyrinth of spaghetti,
Akira
